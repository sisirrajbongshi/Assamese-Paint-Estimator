The Assamese Paint Estimator is a bilingual, web-based application designed to help users calculate the amount of paint required and total cost for painting walls, rooms, or entire houses.
In Assam, manual estimation of paint often results in material wastage or shortage due to inaccurate measurements or lack of standard calculation methods. This project bridges that gap by providing a simple, localized, and accurate tool that can be used by painters, contractors, homeowners, and students alike.

Developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the application computes total wall area based on user input (length, height, and number of walls), applies coverage rates depending on paint type, and determines the required paint volume and estimated cost.
It includes options for selecting different paint types (enamel, plastic, or emulsion), number of coats, and price per litre. The interface supports both Assamese and English, making it accessible to local users.

The system is lightweight, fully client-side, and can operate offline after being loaded once in a browser. Testing with various input values confirmed accurate calculations and consistent performance across devices.
This project demonstrates the application of mathematical logic, user interface design, and localization in software development.
It contributes to the digitization of everyday household and construction-related tasks, aligning with the objectives of accessible and regionally relevant IT solutions.
